**Frolic** is an extended version of the now-defunct F-Chat Rising which itself was an extended version of the [original F-Chat 3.0 client](https://wiki.f-list.net/F-Chat_3.0). Frolic's primary goal is to maintain the existing feature set of F-Chat Rising with touch-ups and bug fixes to keep it functional far into the future.

You'll connect with the same F-List, same players, and same channels you're already used to.
You'll just do it with style!
