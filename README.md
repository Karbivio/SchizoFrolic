<small>While Frolic doesn't mess with your logs, it's always wise to backup important files before installing or upgrading software. Your logs from the vanilla F-Chat desktop client and from F-Chat Rising are located at `%appdata%\fchat\data` on Windows and in `~/.config/fchat/data` on Linux. Frolic continues to use this location so you can continue your conversations right where you left off.</small>


# 🌺 Come Frolic!
**Frolic** is an extended version of the now-defunct F-Chat Rising which itself was an extended version of the [original F-Chat 3.0 client](https://wiki.f-list.net/F-Chat_3.0). Frolic's primary goal is to fine-tune the existing feature set of F-Chat Rising while keeping up with bug fixes and tidying up minor annoyances.

You'll connect with the same F-List, same players, and same channels you're already used to, but with advanced features and quality of life improvements.

For help installing, refer to the [original installation instructions](https://wiki.f-list.net/F-Chat_3.0/Installation).

## Key differences from the original F-Chat client

1. **Profile matching** automatically compares your profile with others to determine with whom you are compatible.
1. **Automatic ad posting** repeatedly posts and rotates ads on selected channels.
1. **Link previews** popup shows a preview of an image / video when you hover your mouse over a link.
1. **Caching** speeds up profile loads and other actions.
1. **Smart filters** let you choose what kind of ads and posts you see in the chat.
